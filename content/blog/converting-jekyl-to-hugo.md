A while back, I read [Julia Evan's post](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/09/switching-to-hugo/) about switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and thought I'd like to give it a try. 

I fiddled with Hugo in the past, but hadn't actually made anything for the real world yet. All in, it took me an evening, one cup of tea, and a box of Smarties to get it done.

I made the decision from the beginning that I wasn't going to port over my styles. I found a theme that was good enough for my purposes and moved on.
