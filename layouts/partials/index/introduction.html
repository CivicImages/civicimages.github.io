<p>I am an ever-curious programmer who loves working with teams to build software that people are excited about. New challenges excite me and I work best when I can draw on the expertise of my teammates to work towards a common goal.</p>

<p> Ruby is the language I know best, and I love working in it. My work often focuses on performance improvements and coaching teams in code design choices. In my current role, I guide performance optimization work and and oversee technical decisions for our platform.</p>

<p>When I have time, <a href="https://dev.to/cassidycodes">I blog on dev.to</a>. I really love it when I get to tackle a challenging problem and then articulate it with documentaiton or a blog post.</p>
